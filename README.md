# Playwright QA Automation Portfolio

This project will showcase automation tests being used to practice Playwright skills.

I will be doing the Pop-Up Challenge on the [Candymapper site](http://www.candymapper.com) recommended to me by [Paul Grossman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmgrossman/), an accomplished automation expert. 

The goal is to run the initial set of tests on candymapper.com as a code exercise in Playwright.

I am also using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) integrated with VS Code to help implement Playwright automation.

The test is [here](https://github.com/AlexMolCode/playwright-automation-tests/blob/main/tests/CandyMapper/candymappercom.spec.ts).
