# Playwright QA Automation Portfolio

This project will showcase automation tests being used to learn Playwright.

To begin with, I will be doing the Pop-Up Challenge on the [Candymapper site](http://www.candymapper.com) recommended to me by [Paul Grossman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmgrossman/). 

The goal is to run the set of tests listed on both candymapper.com and candymapper.net.

I will be using [Claude Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code) integrated with VS Code to help me learn and implement Playwright automation.
