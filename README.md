# Playwright QA Automation Portfolio

This project will showcase automation tests being used to practice Playwright skills.

To begin with, I will be doing the Pop-Up Challenge on the [Candymapper site](http://www.candymapper.com) recommended to me by [Paul Grossman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmgrossman/), an accomplished automation expert. 

The goal is to run the set of tests listed on both candymapper.com and candymapper.net.

I will be using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) integrated with VS Code to help implement Playwright automation.
